## Key Insights


🔑 Key Insights
1️⃣ Revenue Concentration Insight
A small percentage of customers contribute to a disproportionately large share of total revenue.
This highlights the importance of identifying and retaining high-value customers to maximize long-term profitability.

2️⃣ Category / Product Performance Analysis
Certain product categories consistently outperform others in terms of revenue and order volume.
This indicates clear customer preferences and provides opportunities to focus marketing and inventory planning on high-performing categories.

3️⃣ Seasonal & Monthly Trends
Revenue shows noticeable variation across different months, indicating seasonality in customer purchasing behavior.
Understanding these trends can help businesses plan promotions, staffing, and inventory more effectively.

4️⃣ Customer Purchase Behavior
Repeat customers generate higher average revenue per transaction compared to one-time buyers.
This insight supports the importance of customer retention strategies over purely acquisition-focused approaches.

5️⃣ Underperforming Segments
Some products or customer segments consistently show low sales performance.
These segments may require strategic interventions such as pricing adjustments, targeted offers, or discontinuation.
